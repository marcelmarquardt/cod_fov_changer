<h1 align="center" id="title">COD FOV Changer</h1>

<p id="description">For older Call of Duty Games the Field of View (FOV) is limited to a very low number due to console limitations. Those Limiations do not apply for PC and many players like to use a Software which increases the FOV.<br>Such Software is not yet available for Linux so I created it.</p>
